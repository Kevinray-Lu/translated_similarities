Translated Similarity Computation

This project is completed in Summer 2018, aiming to eliminate confusing terms from appearing under one multiple choice question.
The multiple choice question would be asking users to select a correct Chinese translation among 4 choices for an English word. Translations are provided by Google.
The motivation behind the project is: Translations of English words may create multiple phrases instead of a single Chinese word. To eliminate terms having similar meanings with the correct answer needs more work than simply utilizing existing libraries.
